{/* 
The objective is to enable the grandchild component to mutate the grandparent component.
I could prop-drill functions or use React's contextAPI.
However, for the sake of performance, I also want to accomplish the objective without re-rending the DOM.
Therefore, I am considering using the React.useRef() hook to manage the state, along with the React.forwardRef() hook.

Here is structure:
            <OverlayTrigger> // Grandparent
                <OverlayRoot> // Parent
                    <OverylayNav> // Grandchild
                        {children}
                    </OverylayNav>
                </OverlayRoot>
            </OverlayTrigger>
