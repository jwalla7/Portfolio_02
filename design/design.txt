For this project in regards to units of measurement in CSS, I have decided to implement the following structure:

Text - rem: Is relative to the root (html element) font size, not the parent element.
This makes it more predictable and avoids the compounding issue associated with nested elements.

Root Div/Container/Component - vw/vh: Are relative units that are based on a percentage of the viewport's width and height, respectively.

Nested Div/Container/Component - vw/vh or %: Is a relative unit that's based on a percentage of the parent element's property (like width, height, or font size).
